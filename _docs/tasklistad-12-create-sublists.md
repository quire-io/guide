Click on the **+** icon beside the List tab to create a [Sublist](/guide/project-workspace/#sublist). Name the newly created Sublist and add a customized icon. You can choose who to [share the Sublist](/guide/sublist-permission/) with: **Project members** or an **External Team** or keep it **private**. 

**Note:** You wonâ€™t be able to change the Sublist permission once it has been set.

## Add tasks to Sublist
There are several ways to add your tasks to a Sublist. 

You can choose to include or exclude the tasks from the main List when creating a new Sublist. 

**Note:** If you select a root task, the relevant subtasks will also be automatically selected. You can deselect the subtask to choose the tasks you need only. On another hand, subtasks can be selected separately from their root task.
