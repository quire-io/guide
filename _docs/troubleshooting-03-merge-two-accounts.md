When you forget that you have already created a Quire account with a personal email. After using Quire with your work email, you would like to merge both accounts together. 

Follow the below steps:

Step 1: Grant the email A (the one you want to keep) to be admin of all the projects/organizations created by email B.

Step 2: Login in as A and remove the permission of the other one B (the one you donâ€™t want).

Step 3: Delete B account.

Step 4: Add email B as the second email to the account associated with email A in the Account Settings.

Step 5: Both accounts with email A can also be accessed with email B.
