You can search by keywords, task ID, assignees (with `@`), tags (with `#`) and priority (with `!`) to focus on a specific group of tasks by hitting <kbd>s</kbd> on your keyboard.

If you filtered to view All Tasks, you will automatically search among all tasks. The same goes when you filtered to view Incomplete Tasks and Completed Tasks.
