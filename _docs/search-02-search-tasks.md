You can search by keywords, task ID, assignees (with `@`), tags (with `#`) and priority (with `!`) to focus on a specific group of tasks after pressing `s`.

If you filtered to view All Tasks, you will automatically search among all tasks. The same goes when you filtered to view Incomplete Tasks and Completed Tasks.

Note: When you hover a task in the search results, this task will be highlighted in the task list.
