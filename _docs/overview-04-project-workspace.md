In a Quire workspace, you will have mainly three different spaces for you to work on: **List**, **Sublist** and **Overview**.

We will explain more on how each space can help you with your project’s workflow below.

## List
The List is the default view that you will see when you create a new project. It shows your project in a hierarchical list of tasks. 

You can see your ideas broken down into step-by-step tasks, and for each task, you can add [assignees](/guide/set-assignee/), [start and due dates](/guide/set-date-time/), [tags](/guide/assign-tags/), [descriptions](/guide/descriptions/), [comments](/guide/comments/) and more here.

**Tip:** Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> to toggle on and off the full screen mode to see more tasks shown on your workspace.

## Sublist  
The [Sublist](/guide/create-sublists/) allows allows you to create your own **personal view** from the same project.

When you are working with multiple team members in the same project, it’s very likely that after a while, the main List starts to look like a matrix and everyone doesn’t know where to get started.

Sublist can also help you create a focused view for **project members** and even the **External Team** that share the same workload. 

**Note:** The List and the Sublist are mirrored to each other. When you reorder the tasks in a Sublist, the order in the List will also be reordered as well.

## Overview
The Overview shows detailed information/reports of a project.

It includes charts, graphs, summaries and recent activities that show you how much has been done, how much needs to be done, etc.
