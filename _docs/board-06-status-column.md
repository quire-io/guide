## Add a status column 
There are 3 default status columns when you create a new board. To-Do, In Progress and Completed.



You can add new ones and give them a new progress percentage. Click on “Add Columns” to the right of the existing columns. Then type in the name and set its percentage and color respectively. 

Note: The progress percentage can’t be the same as the ones that already existed.
