You can see what has been done to a task in its activity log.

Step 1: Click on a task in the main panel (aka the tree list).

Step 2: In this task’s detail panel, click on **Created by…**. Then, you would see a record of the past actions done to the task:

![task activity log]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/activity-log/task_activity_log.png)
