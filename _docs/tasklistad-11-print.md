Quire allows you to pretty-print your tasks so you can keep a hard copy of all your tasks in your hands.

In Quire, simply go to the project of your choice and then select print. You can hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> for Mac) to print.

![print task list]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/print/print.png)

You can also print out only the task detail panel. This way, you can have a hard copy of the task description and comments. 

Click on the **More Options** icon in the detail panel and select **Print**.
