You can add or edit the assignee, tags, start and due date and priority of a task with `@`, `#`, `<>` (with `;`) and `!` directly from the task name.

For example, type "Publish the article `@crystal` `#Marketing` `<9.30>`" in the task name and press Enter.

![inline assign]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/inline-assign/inline_assign.png)


The task will be assigned to Crystal, and have the tag Marketing and due date of Sept. 30th.

You can also add or remove assignees and tags from a task, without having to type them all over again.

To add one more assignee or tag to a task, type `+@assignee` or `+#tag` in the task name. To remove an existing assignee or tag from a task, type `-@assignee` or `-#tag` instead.

## Inline assign a task

Assign a task to an existing member with `@` directly from the task name.

For example, when you type `Publish the article @crystal` in the task name and press Enter, the task will be assigned to Crystal.


## Inline set a start and due date

Set a start date and due date with `<>` and `;` directly from the task name.

For example, when you type `Publish the article <04/30>` in the task name and press Enter, the task will have a due date of **April 30th**.

![inline assgin due date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/inline-assign/inline_assign_due_date.png)

If you type `<04/30;>` in the task name and press Enter, the task will have a start date of **April 30th**.

If you type `<04/30;05/05>`, the task will have a start date of **April 30th** and a due date of **May 5th**.

In addition, you can type `<today>`, `<tomorrow>` and `<next week>` to quickly set due date too.

You can also type `<+1d>`, `<+1w>` or `<+1m>` to add one more **day**, one more **week** or one more **month** to the due date, counting from today.

You can even type `<+n>` (eg. `<+5>`) or `<-n>` (eg. `<-5>`) to add or remove more days from the start and/or due date, counting from today.

![inline add or remove days]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/inline-assign/inline_add_remove_days.png)

This works in a task's date picker too.
