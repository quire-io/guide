You can bookmark a public (or your own private) project by going to **Recent**/**Projects** category at the left sidebar, and clicking on the **Bookmark** icon.

![add project to bookmark]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bookmark/add_to_bookmark.png)

Once you bookmarked a project, it will appear under the category Bookmarks at the sidebar.
