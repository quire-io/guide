You can copy your tasks from Quire and paste them to another application so that you don’t have to type the entire list again. 

For example, if you want to copy a short list of tasks and send it to a client via Gmail.  

Step 1: Select the tasks you want to copy, press `Ctrl` + `C` (`⌘` + `C` for Mac). 

![copy tasks in Quire]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/copy-to-application/copy_tasks_in_quire.png)

Step 2: Go to Gmail (or other applications like Word, Notepad, etc.), hit `Ctrl` + `V`  (`⌘` + `V` for Mac) to paste. 

![paste to another application]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/copy-to-application/paste_to_application.png)

The task list will automatically turn into bullet points, with assignees, due dates, priority and tags written inline.

**Tip:** If you are copying and pasting tasks in Quire, and now you wish to copy from another application to Quire workspace, you need to press `ESC` first.
