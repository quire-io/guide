**5 Types of Organization Members:**

**Admin** - Can manage all tasks, projects and members in the organization.

**Normal+** - Can manage all tasks and projects (create new projects under the organization), and edit the organization. Normal+ members will not be able to manage the organization's members (including inviting new members or existing members) and delete projects.

**Normal** - Can only see the projects he/she had been invited to, add new projects, and edit the organization. Normal members will not be able to manage the organization's members (including inviting new members or existing members) and delete projects.

**Note:** When Normal members create projects, they become Admins of these projects. But they cannot access other projects they are not members of.
