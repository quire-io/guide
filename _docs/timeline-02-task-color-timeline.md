If a parent task has a different duration than its subtask, the timespan bar of the parent task will mark as a gray slashed bar that covers the time duration of the subtasks as well.

- **Red**: Tasks that are **overdue**. 
- **Blue**: Tasks that are **upcoming** or due **later**. 
- **Gray**: Tasks that have been **completed**. 


#### Color by Priority 
The color will follow the **priority** that has been assigned to the task accordingly. 


#### Color by Tag
The color will follow the **first tag** that has been assigned to the task accordingly. 


#### Color by Status
The color will follow the **status** that has been assigned to the task accordingly. 


#### None
When set to None, the timespan bar will not have any colors.
