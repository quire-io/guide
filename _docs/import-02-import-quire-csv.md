You can organize your work data and information with a spreadsheet-editing tool, then import it into Quire as a project.  

Please make sure that the column format is recognized by Quire. Or else there will be errors when you import the data into Quire. 

Only columns called **Name**, **Assignee**, **Tag**, **Start**, **Due**, **Priority**, **Status**, **Description**, **Parent** and **ID**, in no particular order, and the cells below are recognized. The rest is omitted.

The header column names must be exactly the same with the first letter capitalized.

**Note:** You wonâ€™t be able to invite new assignees or create new tags while importing a CSV file. It will only recognize the existing user ID or email address and tags in your Quire project.
