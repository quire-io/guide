![Quire organization]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/organization-project-task/overview.png)

With a Quire account, you can create or access one or more organizations to collaborate and work on projects with different team members.

Each organization has its own set of projects and projects consist of tasks and subtasks. 


For example, you are the CEO of your company, who is in charge of many departments: Marketing, Accounting, Human Resources, IT and so on. Each department has their own projects.  

For the marketing team, they are running different campaigns. You can create an organization for the marketing team and create projects under that marketing organization such as Social Media Campaign, Brand Awareness Campaign, Advertising etc. 


## Organizations
An organization is a collection of multiple projects. View an organization like a company or a department that works on projects together.

**Note:** When adding members at an organization level, members will be able to see and access all the projects underneath.

## Projects
A project is a collection of tasks. You use a project when you have a big goal and you want to break it down into small tasks.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/organization-project-task/mainpanel.png" alt="this is a placeholder image" caption="Main panel" %}

**Note:** You can add members to the project level, meaning they will only have access to the projects you have granted them permission.

## Tasks
A task is the basic unit of action in Quire. It can be broken down into subtasks, sub-subtasks, and so on. 

You can add a [description](/guide/descriptions/) to tasks or subtasks, [comment](/guide/comments/) in them, [assign](/guide/set-assignee/) them to yourself or others, set [start and due dates](/guide/set-date-time/), [tags](/guide/assign-tags/), and [priority](/guide/set-priority/).
