## Migrate from Asana

After you finish imported your data, the data will be transferred automatically into the tree structure task list view as a default setting. 

All of the subtasks in the description section on Asana will be treated as subtasks in the task list on Quire. 

If you wish to use Kanban Board view, you can add your tasks from your task list view to the board.

## Migrate from Wunderlist

![imported from Wunderlist]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/import-with-json/wunderlist_import_1.png)


All of the lists from the left sidebar in Wunderlist will be treated as root task in Quire, and the tasks inside the lists will be treated as subtasks.

If thereâ€™s a subtask in Wunderlist, it will become the sub-subtask in Quire. 

If you wish to treat each list from Wunderlist as a project in Quire, you can move these tasks to other projects.
