You can add a description, notes or any relevant details to a task.

You can add a description in the task's detail panel.

To break a line in the description, simply press `Enter`.

To preview what you have just typed, press `Ctrl` + `E` or `âŒ˜` + `E` (on Mac). 

The description area also supports markdown to give more styles to your text. You could click on the **Markdown** icon to get a simple cheetsheet of Markdwon.

**Tip:** You can press `d` to write or edit the description of the selected task. <br>
A fast way to see whether the tasks have descriptions or not without opening the detail panel is to hit `Ctrl` (or `Alt` for Mac) for toggling on the breadcrumbs.
