There are 4 types of project members.

- **Admin:** Can manage all tasks and members in the project.

- **Normal:** Can add and edit all tasks and manage the project. Normal members can not manage the project's member (including inviting new members or deleting existing members) and delete the project. 

- **Limited:** Can add tasks, and manage assigned tasks. Limited members will not be able to manage the project's members (including inviting new members or deleting) and delete the tasks created by others.

**Note:** Limited members can only complete tasks that are assigned to or created by them.
