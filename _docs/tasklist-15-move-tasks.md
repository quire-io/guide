No one can anticipate every change that comes in the future. 
You can quickly and easily move your task(s) in the tree list or to other projects to adapt to any change.


## Drag and drop

You can move a task or multiple tasks by dragging them up/down to rearrange its order or left/right to adjust its subtask level.
