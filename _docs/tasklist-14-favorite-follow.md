## Favorite a task

You can favorite a task that you think are important to you. Favorites are personal, unlike tags or priority that are seen by all members.

**Note:** A ♥ means you favorited the task, whereas a ♡ means you didn't. And the number beside either heart indicates how many people have favorited the task.

Go to the detail panel, and click on the ♥ icon in the menu bar.

![favorite task]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/favorite-follow-task/favorite_task.png)

Or you can right-click on the task, and select **Favorite** in the context menu.

![right-click to favorite task]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/favorite-follow-task/favorite_right_click.png)

You can filter by **Favorited by me** to easily see all the tasks you've favorited in this project.

![filter task favorite by me]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/favorite-follow-task/filter_favorite_by_me.png)
