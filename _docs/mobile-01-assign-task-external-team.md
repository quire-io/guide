You can assign tasks to an external team on your mobile devices. 

To create an external team, go to the Overview page of your project. Scroll down to find “External Teams”. 


Tap the **+** sign at the top right corner. Type in the External team name and team member’s email accordingly. You could also set different permission roles to different members by clicking on the Options icon at the right.
