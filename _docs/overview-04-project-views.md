With different positions in a team or different stages in a project, you might need to view your projects in a different way. 

For example, as a team leader, you probably will need the board view more than your team members to visually track the overall project flow and check if any members are running behind.  

Switch between three different views at the header of the project: List, Board, and Overview.

The List view lets you break down your big ideas into smaller doable tasks and subtasks in a nested task list. The Board view helps you get focused on the selected crucial tasks in a visual workflow.

## List
The Lists view is the default view and it shows your project in a hierarchical list of tasks.
 
In this view, you can see your ideas broken down into step-by-step tasks, and for each task, you can [add assignees](/guide/set-assignee/), [start/due dates](/guide/set-date-time/), [tags](/guide/assign-tags/), [descriptions](/guide/descriptions/), [comments](/guide/comments/), and more.

## Board
The Board view shows your project in a visual workflow so you can better manage or focus on a few selected crucial tasks.

In this view, you can add [multiple boards](/guide/multiple-boards) for one project (eg., Preparation, Planning) and in each board, add multiple [status columns](/guide/status-column/) like Development, Testing, Pending, etc.

## Overview
The Overview view shows detailed [information/reports](/guide/project-overview/) of a project.

This view includes charts, graphs, summaries and recent activities that show you how much has been done, how much needs to be done, etc.
