By default, the organizations and projects are in alphabetical order. But you could drag and drop to reorder Organizations or Projects. 

This rearrangement will only be applicable for your **personal view**. Others in the same organizations/ projects won’t be able to see your new rearrangement.

Also, you could transfer a project from one organization to another by dragging and dropping. 

If you want to reset your organization’s order back to the default alphabetical order, click on the **options** icon besides Projects in the sidebar, then click on **Reset to default order**.

For resetting the orders of your projects, click on the **options** icon beside each organization instead. 

![reset projects to default order]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/reorder-projects/reset_project_default.png)
