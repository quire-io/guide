By default, the projects are in alphabetical order at the Projects section at the sidebar. But you could drag and drop to reorder Projects. 

**Note:** This rearrangement will only be applicable for your **personal view**. Others in the same organizations/ projects wonâ€™t be able to see your new rearrangement. 
{: .notice--warning}


![reorder project drag and drop]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/reorder-projects/reorder_project.png)

Also, you could transfer a project from one organization to another by dragging and dropping. 

For resetting the orders of your projects, click on the **three dots** icon beside each organization instead. 

![reset projects to default order]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/reorder-projects/reset_project_default.png)


You can hide your projects to make your Projects section more organized. 

Hover over the project name and click on the **hide** icon. You will find all the hidden projects at the bottom of the Projects section. 


![hide projects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/reorder-projects/hide_projects.png)


To move the project back its original position at the Projects section, click on the **reshow** icon when hovering over the project name.  

![hide projects]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/reorder-projects/reshow_projects.png)
