## Set due date

Decide when a task should be done (aka give it a deadline) by setting a due date.

Click on the **date** icon to set a due date. Or hit `<` on the keyboard when the task(s) is selected.

![set due date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/date_icon.png)

You can click on a shortcut, **Today**, **Tomorrow** or **Next Week** to quickly add a due date. To clear the due date, click **None**.

**Tip:** When editing a task, type `<` to assign a due date inline. See [here](https://quire.io/guide/inline-assign/) for more information.

## Set start date 

You can decide when you would like to start working on a task.

Click on the **date** icon to set a start date. Or hit `<` on the keyboard when the task(s) is selected.

## Set start/due time

Click on **Show more options** at the bottom of the date picker, and toggle on **Set time**.

![set due time]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_time.png)

You can either hit the up or down arrow on your keyboard to select the due time, or type in the hour and minute manually.

## Set tasks as recurring

You can repeat a task that happens periodically. Once you have completed a recurring task, Quire will automatically add the same task in a few seconds with the new date.

Click on **date** icon, and toggle on **Set to repeat** in the datepicker.

![set recurring date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat.png)

Choose how often and what day you want to repeat the task.

![set recurring frequency]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat_frequency.png)

You can also choose to repeat a task since the last day you completed it by choosing **custom** in the dropdown of Repeat.

![set customize recurring]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat_custom.png)
