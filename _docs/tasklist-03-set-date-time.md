## Set due date

Decide when a task should be done (aka give it a deadline) by setting a due date.

#### 3 ways to add a due date:

1. Click on the **date** icon

1. Hit `<` on the keyboard when the task(s) is selected.

1. Type in `<` when editing a task. 

Click on a shortcut, `Today`, `Tomorrow` or `Next Week` to add a due date much faster.

Click `None` to clear the due date.

Click on **Show more options** at the bottom of the date picker, and toggle on **Set time**.

#### To add start time:

Toggle on **Set time** at the bottom of the date picker.

![set time with start date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_time_with_start_date.png)

You can either press the up or down arrow to select the start time, or type the hour and minute manually.

## Set tasks as recurring

You can repeat a task that happens periodically.

Once you have completed a recurring task, Quire will automatically add the same task in a few seconds with the new date.

Step 1: Click on **date** icon, and toggle on **Set to repeat** in the datepicker.

![set recurring date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat.png)


Step 2: Choose how often and what day you want to repeat the task.

![set recurring frequency]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat_frequency.png)

You can also choose to repeat a task since the last day you completed it by choosing **custom** in the dropdown of Repeat.

![set customize recurring]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat_custom.png)
