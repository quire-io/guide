## Set tasks as recurring

You can repeat a task that happens periodically.

Once you have completed a recurring task, Quire will automatically add the same task in a few seconds with the new date.

Step 1: Click on **date** icon, and toggle on **Set to repeat** in the datepicker.

![set recurring date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat.png)

![set recurring frequency]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat_frequency.png)

You can also choose to repeat a task since the last day you completed it by choosing **custom** in the dropdown of Repeat.
