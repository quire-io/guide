## Set due date

You can decide when a task should be done (aka give it a deadline).

To add due date, click on the "date" icon of a task or use < on the keyboard when the task(s) is selected.

Tip: With both start and due date, you can see the period or duration of your tasks when you sync to Google Calendar or other.









## Set tasks as recurring

You can repeat a task that happens periodically.

Once you have completed a recurring task, Quire will automatically add the same task in a few seconds.

First, click on date icon, and toggle the "Set to repeat" option in the datepicker.
