## Set due date

Decide when a task should be done (aka give it a deadline) by setting a due date.

**To add due date:**

1. Click on the **date** icon

1. Hit `<` on the keyboard when the task(s) is selected.

1. Type in `<` when editing a task. 

Click on a shortcut, `Today`, `Tomorrow` or `Next Week` to add a due date much faster.

Click `None` to clear the due date.

Tip: With both start and due date, you can see the period or duration of your tasks when you sync to Google Calendar or other.









## Set tasks as recurring

You can repeat a task that happens periodically.

Once you have completed a recurring task, Quire will automatically add the same task in a few seconds.

First, click on date icon, and toggle the "Set to repeat" option in the datepicker.
