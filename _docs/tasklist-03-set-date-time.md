Setting dates and time to your task in your project can help you to keep track of which tasks are falling behind and which tasks are completed beforehand.

You will also [get reminded](https://quire.io/guide/get-notified/) via in-app notifications or email notifications of upcoming tasks or tasks that are about to be due.

If you switch your List or Sublist to the [Timeline view](/guide/reschedule-tasks-in-timeline/), you can also see your tasks with dates spread out in an horizontal timeline view. It can provide you a clear overview of when the project starts and ends. 


## Set due date

Decide when a task should be done (aka give it a deadline) by setting a due date.

Click on the **date** icon to set a due date. Or hit <kbd><</kbd> on the keyboard when the task(s) is selected.

You can click on a shortcut, **Today**, **Tomorrow** or **Next Week** to quickly add a due date. To clear the due date, click **None**.

**Tip:** When editing a task, type <kbd><</kbd> to assign a due date inline. See [here](https://quire.io/guide/inline-assign/) for more information.

## Set tasks as recurring

You can repeat a task that happens periodically. Once you have completed a recurring task, Quire will automatically add the same task in a few seconds with the new date.

Click on **date** icon, and toggle on **Set to repeat** in the datepicker.

![set recurring date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat.png)

Choose how often and what day you want to repeat the task.

![set recurring frequency]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat_frequency.png)

You can also choose to repeat a task since the last day you completed it by choosing **custom** in the dropdown of Repeat.

![set customize recurring]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-date-time/set_repeat_custom.png)
