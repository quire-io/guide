Next, click **+ Invite new member** to invite people by entering their email addresses or their username.

You can also invite a new member by clicking on the **assignee** icon in the main panel and entering their email addresses or their username.

The newly invited members will automatically join the project once they accept the email invitations.


**Note:** When inviting a member to a new project or organization, the member will show up in the autocomplete dropdown menu if he/she has already been in the same project or organization with you before.
