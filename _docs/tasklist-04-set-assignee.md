## Assign tasks to members who are new to Quire

Click on the **assignee** icon, and type in the person's email to invite him/her to the project. They will automatically join the project once they accept the email invitations.

## For a group of members who are on Quire

You could assign a task to a group of members in a single time by using the External team feature.

Step 1: Go to **Edit members** by clicking on the arrow beside your project names. 

![project members page]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-assignee/edit_members.png)

Step 2: Click on **Create new team** under External Teams, create a external team by typing in a name first.

![create external team]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-assignee/create_external_team.png)

Step 3: Enter the emails of your members.

![add external team members]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-assignee/add_external_team_members.png)

Next time, when you want to a assign a task to a group of members, you don't have to add one single member at a time. Instead, you can choose the external team you've just created. 

![use external team for a group]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/set-assignee/external_team_as_internal_team.png)

## Assign a task to yourself

Click on the **assignee** icon and select yourself, or just press `Ctrl` + `M` on the selected task.
