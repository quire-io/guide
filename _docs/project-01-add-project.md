A project is a collection of tasks. There is no limitation in the number of tasks you can add in one project. You can assign members for each task, add tags, set due days, etc. for better management of your project.

## Add new project

Click on the **+** icon at the upper right corner, then select **Add project**.

Or click on the dropdown menu icon beside the organization name, then select **Add project**. 

![add project]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-project/add_project_2.png)


## Add new project from existing project

When you need to create a project with the same tasks as an existing project, you can just select the existing project as a template when creating a new one. 


![create project from an existing project]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-project/create_project_template.png)
