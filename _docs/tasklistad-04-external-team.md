You can outsource a task or more to a third party, namely the external team, without having them seeing your other tasks or any of your sensitive data. External team members only have access to the tasks assigned to them. They can only create subtasks under the assigned tasks and manage them. 


## Create an external team 

Click on the **dropdown menu** icon beside the project's name. Select **Edit members** in the dropdown menu.

![project options edit members]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/external-team/edit_members.png)

In the External Teams section, click on **+ Create new team**.

![create new external team]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/external-team/create_external_team.png)

Choose a name for the team, and add people by entering their email addresses.

![add new external team name]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/external-team/external_add_team_name.png)

**Note:** The number of external members will count towards the total number of 30 members allowed in each organization.

To edit an external team (eg. remove an external team member), hover the external team's name and click on the **edit (pen)** icon.

![edit external team]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/external-team/external_team_edit.png)

To delete an external team, hover the external team's name and click on the **trash bin** icon.

![delete external team]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/external-team/external_team_delete.png)


## Assign tasks to your external team

Simply click on the **assignee** icon of a task, and turn on the **Assign an external team**.

![assign tasks to external team]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/external-team/assignee_tasks_external_team.png)


**Note:** If the task has already been assigned to an external team, you can still assign it to a project member.
