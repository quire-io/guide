You can outsource a task or more to a third party, namely the external team, without having them seeing your other tasks or any of your sensitive data. External team members only have access to the tasks assigned to them.

## Create an external team 

Step 1: Click on the arrow sign beside the project's name.

Step 2: Select **Edit members** in the dropdown.

Step 3: In the External Teams section, click on **+ Create new team**.

![create new external team]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/external-team/create_external_team.png)

Step 4: Choose a name for the team, and add people by entering their email addresses.

üìù **Note:** The number of external members will count towards the total number of 30 members allowed in each organization.
