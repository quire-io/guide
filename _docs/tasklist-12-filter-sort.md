A list can grow super long and overwhelming over time. It becomes easy to get lost in the long list of to dos. Group, sort and filter your tasks to focus on what matters. 

Click on the **Filter** icon at the top of the list. There’s several predefined filters for you to choose from. 

![predefined filters]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filter-sort/filter_customize.png)

**Tip:** Jump to the filter icon from the selected task by hitting <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> on your keyboard, then use the down arrow to choose the filter.

## View your tasks

Click **Customize** for all the filter options to show. 

- Active Tasks (Includes To-Do and In Progress tasks)
- All Tasks (Includes both Active and Completed tasks)

#### Exclude completed tasks 

Exclude old completed tasks to speed up the performance of the Quire task list/board. 

You can choose to hide tasks that are completed in over 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, 180 days, 300 days, or 500 days. If you want to see all completed tasks, choose **None** instead.

**Note:** This option will appear when you have completed tasks over **60 days** ago.

#### Save a customized filter

When you have a sorting option or filter that you use a lot, you can save it so you don’t have to apply the options every time. 

After applying the filters to your tasks, click on the **star** icon at the end of the filter bar.

![save customized filter]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filter-sort/filter_save.png)

You will find your saved filters in the dropdown menu at the filter icon.
