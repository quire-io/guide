## Upload files from your computer

You can attach one or more files, like documents and images, in a description or comment.

To attach, click on the paperclip icon in the description or comment, or drag and drop the file.

Your attached files may look like below:

![upload attachments]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/attachments/upload_attachments.png)


**Note:** The maximum size allowed for each attached file is 5MB, and a total of 200MB for each organization.

**Tip:** A fast way to see whether the tasks have attachments or not without opening the detail panel is to hit `Ctrl` (or `Alt` for Mac) for toggling on the breadcrumbs.

## Attach files from your Google Drive

Click on the **Google Drive** icon to select a file to be referenced for this task.

![attach files from Google Drive]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/attachments/attach_file_google_drive.png)


## Embed an image

You can embed one or more images in a description or comment to see them directly, instead of attaching them.

Step 1: Click to add or edit a description or comment.

Step 2: Drag and drop the image(s) into the description or comment. 

![embed image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/attachments/embed_image_1.png)

Step 3: Click **Save**, it would look like this.

![embed image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/attachments/embed_image_2.png)

**Tip:** If you use Chrome, you can copy and paste an image in a description or comment.

## Copy and paste an image

If you use Chrome (yes only Chrome), you can copy an image in your computer or any webpage, and paste it in a description or comment.

Step 1: Right-click on the image and select Copy.

![copy and paste image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/attachments/copy_paste_image.png)

Step 2: Go to a description or comment, and right-click to select Paste (or hit `Ctrl` + `V`).

![paste image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/attachments/paste_image.png)

The image would look like this:

![paste image]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/attachments/paste_image_2.png)

**Tip:** You can also embed an image via drag & drop.
