## Attach a file

Click on the paper-clip icon to select a file from your local machine to attach to your task.

You can attach one or more files, like documents and images, in a description or comment.

To attach, click on the paperclip icon in the description or comment, or drag and drop the file.

For example, your attached files may look like this:

Note that the maximum size allowed for each attached file is 5MB, and a total of 200MB for each organization.

Tip: You can see whether tasks have attachments in the main panel (task list) after you press Ctrl (or Alt for Mac).







## Embed an image

You can embed one or more images in a description or comment to see them directly, instead of attaching them.

First, click to add or edit a description or comment.

Next, drag and drop the image(s) into the description or comment:

quire m2 embed image_1.png

After you click on Save, it would look like this:

Tip: If you use Chrome, you can copy and paste an image in a description or comment.







## Copy and paste an image

If you use Chrome (yes only Chrome), you can copy an image in your computer or any webpage, and paste it in a description or comment.

First, right-click on the image and select Copy.
