A list can grow super long and overwhelming over time. It becomes easy to get lost in the long list of to dos. Filter and sort your tasks to focus on what matters. 

Click on the Filter icon at the top of the list. There’s several predefined filters for you to choose from.

**Tip:** Jump to the filter icon from the selected task by hitting `Shift` + `Tab` on your keyboard, then use the down arrow to choose the filter.

#### Exclude completed tasks 

Exclude old completed tasks to speed up the performance of the Quire task list/board. 

You can choose to hide tasks that are completed in over 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, 180 days, 300 days, or 500 days. If you want to see all completed tasks, choose None instead.

#### Save a customized filter

When you have a sorting option or filter that you use a lot, you can save it so you don’t have to apply the options every time. 

After applying the filters to your tasks, click on the star icon at the end of the filter bar.

![save customized filter]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filter-sort/filter_save.png)

You will find your saved filters in the dropdown menu at the filter icon.
