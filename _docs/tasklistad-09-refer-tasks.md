## Refer to tasks

You can refer to a task from the same project by typing `#taskname` or `#taskid` in the description or comment. When the task is completed, the referred task showned in the description or comment will be crossed off automatically. 

![refer a task]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/refer-tasks/refer_task.png)

**Tip:** Toggle on the Advanced mode by hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> for Mac to see the task ID number.

If you want to refer to tasks from a different project, type in `#projectID/taskID` or copy and paste the entire URL of that task. 


## Refer to projects

You can refer to a project by simply typing `#projectid/0` in the description or comment.

You will be able to find the project ID at its URL. It's the characters between w/ and /. 

**Tip:** You can [change your project ID](/guide/edit-project/#edit-project-url) by clicking on the dropdown menu icon beside your project's name at the top of your workspace.
