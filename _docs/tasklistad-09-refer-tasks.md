If you want to refer to tasks from a different project, type in `#projectID/taskID` or copy and paste the entire URL of that task. 


## Refer to projects

You can refer to a project by simply typing `#projectid/0` in the description or comment.

You will be able to find the project ID at its URL. It's the characters between w/ and /. 

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** You can [change your project ID](/guide/edit-project/) by clicking on the arrow beside your project's name at the top of your workspace. Scroll down to Project URL.
