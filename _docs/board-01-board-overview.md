When it comes to executing a complicated project, a simple nested task list may not be enough. 

A task list is for you to dump all of your thoughts and break big ideas down from big goal to digestible tasks. On the other hand, a board aims to help you visually carry out your project step by step.

By moving tasks from one column to another, you can effortlessly manage your team's workflow and keeps every member on the same page. 

Select several crucial tasks that your team needs to focus on in a short period of time (e.g. a week) and add them to a board. When a task is in progress, drag them from the To-Do column to the In Progress column. Throughout the week, you will get a sense of accomplishment when your tasks move towards the Completed column. 

Unlike other project management software that asks you to choose either list or board view for one project, Quire lets you work with both views. The best thing with Quire is, you can **switch** between the nested task list and Kanban board at any time to get the best of both worlds.
