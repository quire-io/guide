You can receive updates about your Quire projects, add tasks to a project, add comments on tasks and many more inside a Slack channel.

Step 1: In an organizaton, click on the Edit(pen) icon.

![organization edit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/slack/organization_edit.png)

Step 2: Go to the Options tab, in **Integrations**, click on **Add to Slack**.

![integrate with slack]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/slack/integrate_slack.png)

Step 3: Go to a Slack channel to link it to a Quire project. In the channel, type `/quire link [project ID or project URL]`. For example: `/quire link Development_Project`.

![slack command link project]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/slack/slack_command_link_project.png)

Step 4: You are all set. Type command `/quire` to get started.

Say you want the team to stay on top of all activities in a Quire project or more in Slack.

Just type the command `/quire follow project [project ID 1] [project ID 2]` in the Slack channel.

For example, `/quire follow project Development_Project Marketing_Project`.
