Next, go to a Slack channel to link it to a Quire project.

In the channel, type `/quire link [project ID or project URL]`.

For example: `/quire link Development_Project`.

Then you are all set. Type command `/quire` to get started.

Say you want the team to stay on top of all activities in a Quire project or more in Slack.

Just type the command `/quire follow project [project ID 1] [project ID 2]` in the Slack channel.

For example, `/quire follow project Development_Project Marketing_Project`.
