#### Share board with project members 

The newly created board will be visible to all of the project members (excluding the External Team). Thereâ€™s no way to customize to selected project members. 


#### Share board with external team

All of the members in External Team can view the tasks within in this board. If you add a task in this board, it is automatically assigned to the External Team. 

However, if you add a parent task with an already assigned subtask to this sublist, the subtask will not be reassigned to the External Team.
