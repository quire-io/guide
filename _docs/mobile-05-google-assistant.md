With Google Assistant, you can keep track of your task list or capture the task that comes to your mind without opening the Quire mobile app. 

**Note:** All of the new tasks will be added to [My Tasks](https://quire.io/guide/my-tasks/) as “personal tasks”.

Start a conversation with Quire by using one of these following statements:
- Ok, Google, let me talk to Quire
- Ok, Google, talk to Quire


Then, just simply say what you want Quire to help you with:

- Remind me to [task name]
- Add a task to [task name] [due date]
