You will see all the tasks that you should care about from all projects and organizations listed in the sidebar's My Tasks.

![my tasks in sidebar]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/my-tasks/my_tasks_sidebar.png)

Tasks that meet below criteria will be shown in My Tasks: 
- Assigned to you
- Created by you but have no assignee
- Favorited by you (You can [turn this settings off](/guide/project-preferences/) by going to the Account Settings.)


The tasks are categorized into Today, Upcoming, Later, etc., based on their due dates.

There are two sorting options for you to choose from. Click on the Options icon (...) at the top right corner.

When **Sort by Date**, all the tasks will order from the oldest due date to newest. 

When **Sort by Project**, the tasks will be separated by projects, but will still order from the oldest due date to newest.
