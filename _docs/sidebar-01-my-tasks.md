My Tasks is a default task list in Quire. You will see all tasks you should care about from all projects and organizations listed in My Tasks.


#### Which tasks will be included in My Tasks?

Tasks in My Tasks can belong to a specific project or just be the personal tasks without being assigned to a project.

The default view for My Tasks is sorted by date. You can sort My Tasks with [two options](/guide/filter-sort/#sort-your-tasks), first by date, then by project, or the other way around.  

- Tasks created by me, not assigned to others, with start or due date
- Task assigned to me
- Personal tasks

#### Personal Tasks

- A personal task is a task that doesn't belong to any project. Rather, it belongs to someone's My Tasks. 
- A private task can have subtasks and all subtasks are all private. If a project is archived or removed, all of its tasks won't be part of my tasks of any user.
- You cannot assign your personal tasks to other users. You can only select yourself as the assignee.
- You cannot create external team for personal tasks. 
- You cannot create global tags for personal tasks. The tag for personal tasks is only visible in My Tasks.

#### What can I do with My Tasks?

- Use the shortcut <kbd>=</kbd> to launch and close My Tasks. 
- Use the shortcut <kbd>m</kbd> to add a task directly to My Tasks.
- If a task was completed 30 days ago, it will not be shown in My Tasks. 
- Transfer personal tasks from My Tasks to other projects by clicking on the **project** icon or by cutting and pasting the tasks.
