Tasks that meet below criteria will be shown in My Tasks: 
- assigned to you
- created by you but have no assignee
- favorited by you (You can turn this settings off by going to the Account Settings.)

And they are categorized into Today, Upcoming, Later, etc., based on their due dates.

There are two sorting options for you to choose from. Click on the Options icon (...) at the top right corner.

When Sort by Date, all the tasks will order from the oldest due date to newest. 
When Sort by Project, the tasks will be separated by projects, but will still order from the oldest due date to newest.
