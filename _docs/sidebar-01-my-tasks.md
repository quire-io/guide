My Tasks is a default task list in Quire. You will see all tasks you should care about from all projects and organizations listed in My Tasks.

#### Which tasks will be included in My Tasks?

- Created by me, no assigned to others, with start or due date
- Assigned to me
- Personal tasks

Those tasks can belong to a specific project or just be the personal tasks without being assigned to a project.

#### What can I do with My Tasks?

- You can use the shortcut `>` to launch and close My Tasks. 
- You can use the shortcut `m` to add a task directly to My Tasks.
- If a task was completed 30 days ago, it will not be shown in My Tasks. 
- Special filters: Group by project and Filter by project. 

#### Personal Tasks

- A personal task is a task that doesn't belong to any project. Rather, it belongs to someone's My Tasks. 
- A private task can have subtasks and all subtasks are all private. If a project is archived or removed, all of its tasks won't be part of my tasks of any user.
- You cannot assign your personal tasks to other users. You can only select yourself as the assignee.
- You cannot create external team for personal tasks. 
- You cannot create global tags for personal tasks. The tag for personal tasks is only visible in My Tasks. 

#### Permission

- You can view other's My Tasks list if you have the access to the projects that those tasks belong to. You cannot view others' personal tasks. 
- You cannot reorder other member's My Tasks list.
