## Favorite a task

You can favorite a task that you think are important to you. Favorites are personal, unlike tags or priority that are seen by all members.

Go to the detail panel, and click on the ♥ icon in the menu bar.

![favorite task]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/favorite-follow-task/favorite_task.png)

Or you can right-click on the task, and select **Favorite** in the context menu.

![right-click to favorite task]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/favorite-follow-task/favorite_right_click.png)

You can filter by **Favorited by me** to easily see all the tasks you've favorited in this project.

![filter task favorite by me]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/favorite-follow-task/filter_favorite_by_me.png)

{: .notice}

📝 **Note:** A ♥ means you favorited the task, whereas a ♡ means you didn't. And the number beside either heart indicates how many people have favorited the task.

## Follow a task

You can follow, or add followers to a task to get notified of any changes made to it.

Go to the detail panel, and click on the **eye** icon in the upper-right.

![follow a task]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/favorite-follow-task/follow_task.png)

Or you can right-click on the task, and select **Follow** in the context menu.

{% capture notice-text %}
📝 **Note:** 
- When you create a new task, you will automatically become the follower of that task. 
- If you are the follower of a parent task, when other members add subtasks underneath, you will become the follower of the subtasks as well.
