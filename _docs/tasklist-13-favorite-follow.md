## Favorite a task

You can favorite a task that you think are important to you. Favorites are personal, unlike tags or priority that are seen by all members.

First, go to the task's detail panel, and click on the ♥ icon in the menu bar.

Next, you can filter by "Favorited by me" to easily see all the tasks you've favorited in this project.

You can also find all of the tasks you've favorited from all projects in the My Tasks tab in the sidebar, in addition to those assigned to you.

For more info, you can check out the blog post here.

Note: A ♥ means you favorited the task, whereas a ♡ means you didn't. And the number beside either heart indicates how many people have favorited the task.





## Follow a task

You can follow, or add followers to a task or a project to get notified of any changes made to it.

### To follow a task:

Go to the task's detail panel, and click on the eye icon in the upper-right.
