External teams are external members outside your teams. They only have access to the tasks assigned to them.

Note: The number of external members will count towards the total number of 30 members allowed in each organization.










## Assign a task to your external team

You can outsource a task or more to a third party, namely the external team, without having them seeing your other tasks or any of your sensitive data.

To do this, simply click on the assignee icon of a task, and turn on the "Assign an external team" switch button.
