You can add status to a task to tell your teammates where it is at.

In the task's detail panel, click on the arrow beside the "Complete" icon to choose a status.

There are three task statuses: To-Do, In Progress and Completed.

If a task's status is To-Do, it means nobody has started working on it.

If a task's status is In Progress, it means someone has started working on it.

If a task's status is Completed, it means the task is done.
