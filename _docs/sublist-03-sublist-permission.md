There are three options for you to share the sublist with: Project Members, External Team and Personal (yourself).

Learn how to create a [sublist](/guide/add-sublist/).

#### Share sublist with project members 

The newly created sublist will be visible to all of the project members (excluding the External Team). Thereâ€™s no way to customize to selected project members.

#### Share sublist with external team

All of the members in External Team can view the tasks within in this sublist. If you add a task in this sublist, it is automatically assigned to the External Team. 

However, if you add a parent task with an already assigned subtask to this sublist, the subtask will not be reassigned to the External Team.

#### Create a personal sublist 

The newly created sublist will be visible to you only. Other project members cannot view or edit the sublist even with the shared link.
