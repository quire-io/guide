#### When will you get notified?

You will receive [reminder notifications](/guide/reminders/) and [reminder emails](/guide/email-notifications/ ) when your tasks approach their start date or time, due date or time, and also when they are overdue.

Also, when someone added a task in a project you follow, or left a comment in a task you follow, you will immediately get notified in Quire.

You will be notified of the following activities if you are:

|  | Project Member   | Project Follower | Task Assignee | Task Follower |
|:------------- | :-------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: | :--------------: |
| Activities in project | | v | | | 
| Activities in task assigned to you | v | v | v | v |
| Activities in task assigned to other | | v | | v |
| Activities in task not assigned | | v | | v |
