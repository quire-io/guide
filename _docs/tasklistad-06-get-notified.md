You will be notified of new updates, upcoming tasks or overdue tasks in different places.

- [Notifications](/guide/reminders/) at the bell icon at the upper right corner of your Quire workspace.

- [Email notifications](/guide/email-notifications/).

#### When will you get notified?

You will receive [reminder notifications](/guide/reminders/) and [reminder emails](/guide/email-notifications/ ) when your tasks approach their start date or time, due date or time, and also when they are overdue.

Also, when someone added a task in [a project you follow](/guide/follow-project/), or left a comment in [a task you follow](/guide/favorite-follow-task/#follow-a-task), you will immediately get notified in Quire.

**Note:** When another member comments on a task you follow or assigns a task to you, an **orange dot** will appear next to the task name.
