## Post a comment


You can chat, discuss and show what you have accomplished in the comments of a task or project.

In a task:

Go to a project's Task Tree view and click on a task to post comments in its detail panel.

Tip: You can press c to post comments in the selected task.

To break a line in the comment, you can simply press Enter.

To give styles to your text, click on the "?" icon to get helps on Markdown.

To preview what you have just typed, press Ctrl + E or Cmd + E (for Mac)

When you left a comment in a task, you will be notified automatically of any updates on this task. For example, when someone changed its due date or left a new comment.

Members who are already the assignees of this task, or followers of this task or its project, will be notified automatically of any updates too.

Tip: You can see whether tasks have comments in the main panel (task list) after you press Ctrl (or Alt for Mac).







## Pin a comment

You can pin (and unpin) a task's comment by clicking on the down arrow
