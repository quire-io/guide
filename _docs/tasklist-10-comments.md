## Post a comment

You can chat, discuss and share about what you have accomplished in the comments of a task in the detail panel. 

To preview what you have just typed, press `Ctrl` + `E` or `âŒ˜` + `E` (on Mac)

The comment area also supports markdown to give more styles to your text. You could click on the **Markdown** icon to get a simple cheetsheet of Markdwon.

Add emojis to make your description stand out. Type in `:` to get emoji cheet sheet or you can copy and paste an emoji from websites like getemoji.com.

When you leave a comment in a task, you will automatically become the follower of that task, meaning when other members modify the task's due date or leave another comments, etc. You will get notifications as well. 

Members who are already the assignees of this task or followers of this task or its project will get notified automatically of any updates too.

**Tip:** You can press `C` to post comments in the selected task.<br>
A fast way to see whether the tasks have comments or not without opening the detail panel is to hit `Ctrl` (or `Alt` for Mac) for toggling on the breadcrumbs.
