## Post a comment

You can chat, discuss and share about what you have accomplished in the comments of a task in the detail panel.

It's your instant messenger built right in Quire! Simply click **Add comment** in the detail panel and start chatting.

When you leave a comment in a task, you will automatically become the **follower** of that task, meaning when other members modify the task's due date or leave other comments, etc. You will get notifications as well. 

Members who are already the assignees of this task or followers of this task or its project will get notified automatically of any updates too.

**Tip:** You can hit <kbd>C</kbd> to post comments in the selected task. A quick way to see whether the tasks have comments or not without opening the detail panel is to hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (or <kbd>Alt</kbd> for Mac) for toggling on the [Advanced mode](/guide/advanced-mode/).

#### Style your comments

The comment area supports markdown to give more styles to your text. You could click on the **Markdown** icon to get a simple cheat sheet of Markdown.

To preview what you have just typed, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> for Mac.
