Start working on your project by breaking down your ideas into a list of tasks. To create a new task, tap on the **green + button** at bottom right corner of the screen. 

You can give your tasks [more details](/guide/mobile-app-task/), such as assigning due dates, setting assignees and adding tags.

## Views

There are several different views for a project: **List**, **Sublist**, **Board**, and **Overview**. List view is the default view when you first access the project.

  <source src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mobile-app-project/mobile_add_sublist_board.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>



#### Create a sublist or a board 
[Sublists](https://quire.io/guide/sublist-introduction/) allows you to create your own personal list view from the same project. [Boards](https://quire.io/guide/board-overview/) helps you visualize your project in different stages.

 
Tap on the project name at the top, then **Add board** or **Add sublist**. 

  
#### Switch to different views 
Tap on the project name at the top, then you will be able to access different views of the project. 


## Filters

The default filter for each task list is **Active Tasks**. 

Tap on the **filter** icon at the upper right corner to access a list of preset filters, such as Group by assignee and Group by date.

  <source src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/mobile-app-project/mobile_filter_menu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


In the filter menu, create your own filter by tapping on **Customize**. Swipe right and left to switch between different filter options. 

After finish customizing your own filter, tap **Apply**. 

**Tip:** You can group or filter your tasks up to two different options.

## Project members

## Global tags

If you would like to view all of your tags for the project, tap on the **options** icon at the upper right corner, then **Edit project**, then **Project tags**. 

If you set the tags to be **Visible to all projects**, you wonâ€™t need to create the same tags again in other projects within the same organization.

To set the tags visible to all projects (global tags), tap on the **options** icon for the tag, then **Edit tag**, and toggle on **Visible to all projects**.

**Tip:** You can also toggle between two display modes by shaking your phone.
