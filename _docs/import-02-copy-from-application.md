You can copy your tasks from Quire and paste them to another application so that you don’t have to type the entire list again. 

For example: if you want to copy a short list of tasks and send it to a client via Gmail.  

First, select the tasks you want to copy, press Ctrl+C (⌘+C for Mac).

Then, go to Gmail (or other applications like Word, Notepad, etc.), press Ctrl+V  (⌘+V for Mac) to paste.

The task list will automatically turn into bullet points, with assignees, due dates, priority and tags written inline.

Tip: If you are copying and pasting tasks in Quire, and now you wish to copy from another application to Quire workspace, you need to press ESC first.
