You can copy and paste your work to Quire as tasks, to save you trouble from entering them one by one.

For example, you can copy a bullet list in Word and Notepad, an email content in Gmail, and also tabular data in Excel spreadsheet and CSV file, and then paste it to Quire.

First, you press Ctrl + C (or ⌘ + C for Mac) to copy the content.
