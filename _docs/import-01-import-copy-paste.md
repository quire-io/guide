You can copy and paste your work to Quire as tasks, to save you trouble from entering them one by one.

For example, you can copy a bullet list from a Word file or Notepad, an email content in Gmail, or a tabular data in Excel spreadsheet and CSV file, and then paste it to Quire.

Step 1: Hit `Ctrl` + `C` (or `⌘` + `C` for Mac) to copy the content.

![copy from a notepad]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/import-via-copy-paste/copy_paste_notepad.png)

Step 2: Go to your Quire project, click on a task and right click to select **Paste** or hit `Ctrl`+ `V` (or `⌘` + `V` for Mac).

If everything looks good, click **Paste**, or you can hit `Ctrl` + `V` again.
