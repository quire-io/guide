Quire allows to create a task list with multiple levels. But sometimes you only want to see certain levels of tasks.

You can right click on the **Collapse/Expand** icon of a task for options to expand the tasks.

![Collapse/Expand]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/expand-collpase/expand_collapse.jpg)

Or you could use below keyboard shortcuts to collapse/expand a level at a time. 

- Hit `←` to collapse a group tasks by level 	
- Hit `→` to expand a group tasks by level 
- Hit `Shift` + `←` to collapse all tasks by level 
- Hit `Shift` + `→` tp expand all tasks by level
