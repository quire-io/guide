Quire allows to create a task list with multiple levels. But sometimes you only want to see certain levels of tasks.

You can right click on the collapse (expand) icon of a task for options to expand the tasks.

Or you could use below keyboard shortcuts to expand/ collapse a level at a time. 

Collapse a group tasks by level `←`	
Expand a group tasks by level `→`
Collapse all tasks by level `Shift` + `←`
Expand all tasks by level `Shift` + `→`
