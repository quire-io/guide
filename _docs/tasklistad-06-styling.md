You can add color, bold, italic, strikethrough, code,  as well as characters to your tasks, so they become more distinguishable.

For example, you can type the following in a task name, description and comment:

### Color
`{css-style| text} (eg., {color: red|text})`

### Bold
`**text**`

`*text*`

Tip: You can also make your project or organizaton name bold and/or italic.

### Underline
`_text_`

### Strikethrough (Crossed Out)

### Table

`| Left   | Center   | Right |` <br>
`| :------ |:-----------:| ------:|` <br>
`| A | text A | word A |` <br>
`| B | text B | word B |` <br>
`| C | text C | word C |` <br>

Tip: You can type `<br>` to break a line in a table cell, and `\<br>` to escape (keep `<br>` in the cell).



### Characters
You can type &yen;, &reg;, &#8451; and &#x263B; which will turn into ¥, ®, ℃, ☻, respectively. These are just a few examples of html entities you can enter in a task name, description or comment.

To quickly add some of the basic styles, simply type { and select the style you want.
