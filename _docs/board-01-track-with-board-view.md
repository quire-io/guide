## Move tasks across columns
You can drag and drop your tasks from column to column to reorganize your work or move it to the next status.

Or you can drag the tasks up and down to reorder your column list. The tasks that are higher in the column can represent higher priority. 


**Note:** The task order in each column will not affect the order in the Tree view.
