By pressing Ctrl (or Alt for Mac), you will be able to see the IDs of tasks, the root and parent tasks, and attachment icons of tasks if any.

If you are in a sort-by view or filter-by view, you will also see the context (aka breadcrumbs) of tasks.

For example, after you sort by Date and press Ctrl (or Alt), you will see:

alt.png

Tip: You will also see the organization the current project belongs to at the top when you toggle Ctrl (or Alt).
