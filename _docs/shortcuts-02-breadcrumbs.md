By hitting `Ctrl` (or `Alt` for Mac), you will be able to see the IDs of tasks, the root and parent tasks, and attachment icons of tasks if any.

If you are in a sort-by view or filter-by view, you will also see the context (aka breadcrumbs) of tasks.

For example, after you sort by Date and press Ctrl (or Alt), you will see:

![ctrl alt mode]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/breadcrumbs/alt.png)

**Tip:** You will also see the organization the current project belongs to at the top when you toggle `Ctrl` (or `Alt`).
