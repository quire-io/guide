When your list grows a tad overwhelming, you can pick several tasks that are not actionable at the moment and peekaboo them. The peekaboo tasks will remain hidden from the List/ Board view and reshow several days later. 

In the task's detail panel, click on **Options** and choose **Peekaboo** in the dropdown menu.

You can also peekaboo a task by right-clicking and selecting **Peekaboo** in the context menu.

If the peekaboo tasks aren’t completed yet, it will automatically reshow back in the list after 7 days by default. Or you can set the peekaboo tasks to reshow 1, 3, 14, 30 days later or never show again.
