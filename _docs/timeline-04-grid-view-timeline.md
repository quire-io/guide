Since the task list in the Timeline view shows very limited information, you can toggle on the **Grid view** by clicking on the Timeline button. 

The default columns in the Grid view are **Status**, **Priority**, **Assignee**, **Tags**, **Start**, and **Due**. You can choose more options that you want to show in the dropdown menu. You can resize the column width if needed.
