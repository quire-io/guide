#### Create a Sublist

Step 1: Click on the **+** icon and choose **Add sublist**.

![add sublist]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-sublist/add_views.png)

Step 2: Select the important tasks to add to the sublist. You can name the newly created sublist and add a customized icon for the sublist title. There are three options for you to share the sublist with: Project Members, External Team, Personal (yourself). 

![create sublist popup]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-sublist/create_sublist_pop.png)

**Note:** If you select the root task, the relevant subtasks will also be automatically selected. You can deselect the subtask to choose the tasks you need only. On another hand, subtasks can be selected separately from their root task.

#### Pin and unpin the sublist for quick navigation 

![pin sublist]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/add-sublist/pin_sub.png)

**Note:** The newly created sublists will be pinned by default. On the other hand, sublists created by other members will not be pinned.

#### Create as many sublists as you need

There is no limitation on how many sublists you can create for a project. A big dream now can be broken down into smaller and manageable to-do lists and sublists.
