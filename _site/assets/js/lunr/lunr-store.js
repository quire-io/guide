        "excerpt":"   With a Quire account, you can create or access one or more organizations to collaborate and work on projects with different team members.   Each organization has its own set of projects and projects consist of tasks and subtasks.   For example, you are the CEO of your company, who is in charge of many departments: Marketing, Accounting, Human Resources, IT and so on. Each department has their own projects.   For the marketing team, they are running different campaigns. You can create an organization for the marketing team and create projects under that marketing organization such as Social Media Campaign, Brand Awareness Campaign, Advertising etc.   Organizations  An organization is a collection of multiple projects. View an organization like a company or a department that works on projects together.   Learn how to create a new organization.      Note: When adding members at an organization level, members will be able to see and access all the projects underneath.   Projects  A project is a collection of tasks. You use a project when you have a big goal and you want to break it down into small tasks.   Learn how to create a new project.                     Sidebar: Projects in the sidebar are grouped by Organization.

Tasks  A task is the basic unit of action in Quire. It can be broken down into subtasks, sub-subtasks, and so on.   You can add a description to tasks or subtasks, comment in them, assign them to yourself or others, set start and due dates, tags, and priority.

If you are a member at the organization level, you would have access to all the projects underneath. If you are a member at the project level, you would only have access to the projects that you have been granted permission.   For example, Brandon and Nathan both have access to all of the projects under their own organizations. However, Nathan can also access to Brandon’s Project 1 because he was granted with permission with Project 1 but not the otherprojects in Brandon’s organization.   Another unique kind of member: External Team. When you want to outsource your tasks to someone outside of your team, assign them to an External Team. External Team members can only access the tasks assigned to them.   Learn how to create an External Team.   Project Members  Project members are Quire users who have been invited and have confirmed to join a particular project.   A project member can add, move, delete, edit tasks in the project.   Manage your project members by going to the Members page of your project: click on the arrow beside the project name.      Note: There are 4 types of project members: Admin, Normal, Limited, Guest. All four have different permission controls over the tasks and members in the project.   Organization Members  Organization members are Quire users who have been invited and have confirmed to join a particular organization. An organization member can access projects underneath the organization, and add, move, delete, edit tasks within those projects.

For example, as a team leader, you probably will need the board view more than your team members to visually track the overall project flow and check if any members are running behind.   Switch between three different views at the header of the project: List, Board, and Overview.      The List view lets you break down your big ideas into smaller doable tasks and subtasks in a nested task list. The Board view helps you get focused on the selected crucial tasks in a visual workflow.   Learn more about our approach here. (What Project Management Did Wrong)   List  The Lists view is the default view and it shows your project in a hierarchical list of tasks.   In this view, you can see your ideas broken down into step-by-step tasks, and for each task, you can add assignees, start/due dates, tags, descriptions, comments, and more.      Board  The Board view shows your project in a visual workflow so you can better manage or focus on a few selected crucial tasks.   In this view, you can add multiple boards for one project (eg., Preparation, Planning) and in each board, add multiple status columns like Development, Testing, Pending, etc.      Overview  The Overview view shows detailed information/reports of a project.   This view includes charts, graphs, summaries and recent activities that show you how much has been done, how much needs to be done, etc.      ","categories": ["project","views"],

A task list is for you to dump all of your thoughts and break big ideas down from big goal to digestible tasks. On the other hand, a board aims to help you visually carry out your project step by step.   By moving tasks from one column to another, you can effortlessly manage your team’s workflow and keeps every member on the same page.   Select several crucial tasks that your team needs to focus on in a short period of time (e.g. a week) and add them to a board. When a task is in progress, drag them from the To-Do column to the In Progress column. Throughout the week, you will get a sense of accomplishment when your tasks move towards the Completed column.   Unlike other project management software that asks you to choose either list or board view for one project, Quire lets you work with both views. The best thing with Quire is, you can switch between the nested task list and Kanban board at any time to get the best of both worlds.
